# Atlas Back-End

## Overview

This repository contains back-end development projects and exercises for the Atlas Engineering program. It focuses on server-side programming, APIs, databases, and other back-end technologies essential for modern web application development.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific project or technology:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `api/` | Projects related to API development, consumption, and data extraction |
| `python/` | Python-based back-end projects and exercises |
| `javascript/` | JavaScript/Node.js back-end implementations |
| `databases/` | Database-related projects (SQL, NoSQL, ORM) |
| `authentication/` | User authentication and authorization implementations |
| `caching/` | Caching strategies and implementations |
| `web_server/` | Web server configuration and deployment |

## API Projects

The `api/` directory contains projects focused on working with APIs:

- **Data Extraction**: Scripts to fetch and process data from REST APIs
- **API Development**: Creating RESTful APIs using various frameworks
- **Authentication**: Implementing secure API authentication methods
- **Documentation**: Tools and examples for API documentation

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **Frameworks**: Flask, Express.js, Django
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Tools**: Postman, Swagger, Docker
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atlas-back-end.git
cd atlas-back-end



Set up a virtual environment for Python projects:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt



Install Node.js dependencies for JavaScript projects:
cd javascript
npm install
